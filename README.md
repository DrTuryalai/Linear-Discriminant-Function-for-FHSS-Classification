# Linear-Discriminant-Function-for-FHSS-Classification
This repository contains the implementation of the linear discriminant (LD) function for the classification of FHSS Signals by comparing estimated and ideal parameters.

# Codes
Run the main files for each FHSS signal to perform the Monte Carlo Simulation. Note that fastest, fast, medium, slow, and slowest correspond to FHSS_1, FHSS_2, FHSS_3, FHSS_4, and FHSS_5, respectively. Change the background signal power by changing 'strong' to strongest or weak. Here, strongest, strong, and weak refer to Case 4, Case 3, and Case 2, respectively, whereas for Case 1, comment out the background signal line of code.
